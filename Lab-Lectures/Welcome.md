# Welcome to "Bayesian Modeling and Inference: An Introduction to Stan"!

Hello and welcome to this short course on Bayesian Statistics and its practical application using Stan!

## What This Course Covers:

This course aims to provide you with a foundational understanding of Bayesian principles and equip you with the skills to start building and interpreting Bayesian models. We'll cover:

*   **Core Concepts:** What is Bayesian probability? Priors, Likelihood, and Posteriors.
*   **Bayesian vs. Frequentist:** Understanding the key differences in philosophy and interpretation.
*   **Computational Methods:** An introduction to MCMC, HMC, and NUTS â€“ the engines behind modern Bayesian analysis.
*   **Practical Modeling with Stan:**
    *   Bayesian Linear Regression
    *   Bayesian Logistic Regression
*   **Model Assessment:** MCMC diagnostics, posterior predictive checks, and model comparison techniques (like LOO/WAIC).

## Fun Facts & A Bit of History:

*   **Bayes' Theorem is Over 250 Years Old!** Thomas Bayes first presented his ideas in the 1740s, though they were published posthumously in 1763. It took a long time for their full potential to be realized, largely due to computational limitations.
*   **The "Bayesian Brain" Hypothesis:** Some neuroscientists propose that the human brain itself operates in a way that can be described by Bayesian inference, constantly updating its "model" of the world based on sensory input (data) and prior expectations.
*   **From Spam Filters to Space Exploration:** Bayesian methods are everywhere! They're used in email spam filters (e.g., Naive Bayes classifiers), medical diagnostics, machine learning, astrophysics (e.g., finding exoplanets), finance, and much more.
*   **The Name "Stan":**
    The programming language Stan, which we'll be using, was named after **Stanislaw Ulam**, a Polish-American mathematician. Ulam was a key figure in the development of the **Monte Carlo method** in the 1940s while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. The Monte Carlo method, which involves using random sampling to obtain numerical results, is absolutely foundational to modern Bayesian computation (like MCMC). So, "Stan" is a tribute to Stanislaw Ulam and the rich lineage of Monte Carlo methods that the language builds upon for probabilistic modeling and inference.

I hope you enjoy the course and find it a valuable introduction to the exciting world of Bayesian statistics!
